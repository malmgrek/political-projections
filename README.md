# Poliparties â€“ political party demo


## Introduction

This project implements some simple dimensionality reduction methods for the
"expert leven dataset" [2019 Chapel Hill expert
survey](https://www.chesdata.eu/2019-chapel-hill-expert-survey "2019_CHES"). In
principle similar methods are applicable to any (e.g.) standardizable survey
datasets. However, the main aim is to demonstrate a possible layout of a Python
data analysis project.

## Installation

## Development
